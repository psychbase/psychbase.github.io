**The psychotropic effects of DMT were studied scientifically by Stephen Szára in clinical studies performed in the 1950s**

>I was joined by three other psychiatrists András Sai-Halász, Zoltán Böszörményi, and Györgyi Brunecker who helped me to recruit, and test
about 30 volunteers. In agreement with my coworkers, I sent in a short, preliminary report to the Swiss journal Experientia in the summer of 1956
before the Hungarian Revolution happened (Szára, 1956). The full reports appeared only two years later (Sai-Halász, Brunecker and Szára, 1958; Böszörményi and Szára, 1958).

>The effects of a medium effective dose (0.7 mg/kg) given  intramuscularly, were similar to those of mescaline and LSD: visual illusions and hallucinations, distortion of body image, speech disturbances, and mood changes: euphoria or anxiety (depending on set
and setting). The most remarkable aspect of the effects was the rapid onset (2-5 minutes) and short duration (30-60 minutes). These effects have been replicated by a number of independent groups of investigators (Turner and Merlis 1959; Rosenberg et al 1963; Gillin et al, 1976; Strassman et al 1994).

**It was known no later than 1959 that 5-MeO-DMT is a natural product found in the bark of *Dictyoloma incanescens***

>The bark of the Brazilian tree *Dictyoloma incanescens* D.C. yielded a new alkaloid, N,N-dimethyl-5-methoxytryptamine
