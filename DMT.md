**The psychotropic effects of DMT were studied scientifically by Stephen Szára in clinical studies performed in the 1950s**

>The effects of a medium effective dose (0.7 mg/kg) given  intramuscularly, were similar to those of mescaline and LSD: visual illusions and hallucinations, distortion of body image, speech disturbances, and mood changes: euphoria or anxiety (depending on set
and setting). The most remarkable aspect of the effects was the rapid onset (2-5 minutes) and short duration (30-60 minutes). These effects have been replicated by a number of independent groups of investigators (Turner and Merlis 1959; Rosenberg et al 1963; Gillin et al, 1976; Strassman et al 1994).
