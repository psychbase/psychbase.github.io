**Psilocybin has been consumed by humans**
>Systematic examination of its action on human subjects was carried out by volunteers in Basle during 1959

**Milligram doses of psilocybin have effects on humans**
>Small doses of a few milligrams produce within 20 to 30 minutes both somatic and mental changes. The somatic effects are mainly neurovegetative, such as mydriasis, hyperreflexia, hypertension or hypotension, changed pulse frequency, etc. In small doses the drug produces a change in mood and in contact with the environment which is subjectively pleasant and consists of relaxation and detachment from the outside world. In higher doses, changes in orientation and psychosensory phenomena develop, such as visual hypernesthesia, illusions and hallucinations. They are, however, not as frequent as those following lysergic acid-diethylamide and especially following mescaline.

**One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to administer psilocybin for therapy**
>There may be some advantages to therapy with this drug as compared with lysergic acid-diethylamide, whose prolonged action and consequent production of anxiety are a well-known deterrent to its widespread use. Cerletti expresses the hope that clinical investigation combined with biochemical clarification of the connection between psilocybin and endogenous metabolism of indol will succeed in removing the mystery from these small mushrooms with their traditional magic action.
