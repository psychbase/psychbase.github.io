#microdosing

**Milligram doses of psilocybin have effects on humans**
>Small doses of a few milligrams produce within 20 to 30 minutes both somatic and mental changes. The somatic effects are mainly neurovegetative, such as mydriasis, hyperreflexia, hypertension or hypotension, changed pulse frequency, etc. In small doses the drug produces a change in mood and in contact with the environment which is subjectively pleasant and consists of relaxation and detachment from the outside world. In higher doses, changes in orientation and psychosensory phenomena develop, such as visual hypernesthesia, illusions and hallucinations. They are, however, not as frequent as those following lysergic acid-diethylamide and especially following mescaline.

**Sub-perceptual (e.g., sub-hallucinogenic) doses of psychedelics have therapeutic effects on humans**
>The popular media has described consumption of psychedelics in doses much lower than typical therapeutic doses (Fadiman, 2011; Leonard, 2015; Solon, 2016; Waldman, 2017) and articles and anecdotes claim benefits including improved mood, focus, and creativity alongside decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety. While decreased depression and anxiety are consistent with research on full-dose psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017; Griffiths et al., 2016), microdosing could offer these benefits without any perceptual distortions and reduced need for expensive clinical oversight typical of full-dose psychedelic psychotherapy.

>Some LSD uses are still well below the radar. The most intriguing of these uses are sub-perceptual doses of about 10 micrograms. In that tiny amount, LSD acts like a cognitive enhancer, but without the side effects of larger doses.

Fadiman at page 193

>Although no formal research exists on sub-perceptual doses, a growing number of people have been using psychedelics this way. When people take a sub-perceptual amount—for LSD, about 10 micrograms (also known as a micro-dose, sub-dose, or "tener")—the common sensory effects associated with higher doses of LSD or psilocybin—a glow or a sparkle around the edges of living things, sensory interweaving such as hearing in color or tasting music, and a loosening of ego boundaries—do not appear.

Griffiths administered low doses of psilocybin to humans as a placebo in studying the effects of high doses of psilocybin to treat depression and anxiety
